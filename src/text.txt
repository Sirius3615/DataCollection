Croatia's name derives from Medieval Latin Croātia itself a derivation of NorthWest Slavic Xərwate by liquid metathesis from Common Slavic period Xorvat from proposed ProtoSlavic Xъrvátъ which possibly comes from the 3rdcentury ScythoSarmatian form attested in the Tanais Tablets as Χοροάθοςcode ell promoted to code el  Khoroáthoscode ell promoted to code el  alternate forms comprise Khoróatoscode ell promoted to code el  and Khoroúathoscode ell promoted to code el [11] The origin is uncertain but most probably is from ProtoOssetian  Alanian xurvæt or xurvāt in the meaning of "one who guards" "guardian protector"[12] The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym xъrvatъ is of the variable stem attested in the Baška tablet in style zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ "Zvonimir Croatian king"[13] although it was archaeologically confirmed that the ethnonym Croatorum is mentioned in a church inscription found in Bijaći near Trogir dated to the end of the 8th or early 9th century[14] The presumably oldest stone inscription with fully preserved ethnonym is the 9thcentury Branimir inscription found near Benkovac where Duke Branimir is styled Dux Cruatorvm likely dated between 879 and 892 during his rule[15] The Latin term Chroatorumcode lat promoted to code la  is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir I of Croatia dated to 852 in a 1568 copy of a lost original but it is not certain if the original was indeed older than the Branimir inscription[16][17]
The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period Neanderthal fossils dating to the middle Palaeolithic period were unearthed in northern Croatia best presented at the Krapina site[18] Remnants of Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions[19] The largest proportion of sites is in the valleys of northern Croatia The most significant are Baden Starčevo and Vučedol cultures[20][21] Iron Age hosted the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture[22]
Much later the region was settled by Illyrians and Liburnians while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of Hvar[23] Korčula and Vis[24] In 9 AD the territory of today's Croatia became part of the Roman Empire Emperor Diocletian was native to the region He had a large palace built in Split to which he retired after abdicating in AD 305[25]
During the 5th century the last de jure Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475[26] The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast islands and mountains The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum[27]
The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain The most accepted theory the Slavic theory proposes migration of White Croats from White Croatia during the Migration Period Conversely the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin based on Tanais Tablets containing Ancient Greek inscriptions of given names Χορούαθος Χοροάθος and Χορόαθος Khoroúathos Khoroáthos and Khoróathos and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people[28]
According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by 10thcentury Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Croats arrived in the Roman province of Dalmatia in the first half of the 7th century after they defeated the Avars[29][30][31] However that claim is disputed competing hypotheses date the event between the late 6thearly 7th mainstream or the late 8thearly 9th fringe centuries[32][33] but recent archaeological data has established that the migration and settlement of the SlavsCroats was in the late 6th and early 7th century[34][35][36] Eventually a dukedom was formed Duchy of Croatia ruled by Borna as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818 The record represents the first document of Croatian realms vassal states of Francia at the time[37] Its neighbor to the North was Principality of Lower Pannonia at the time ruled by duke Ljudevit who ruled the territories between the Drava and Sava rivers centred from his fort at Sisak This population and territory throughout history was tightly related and connected to Croats and Croatia[38]
According to Constantine VII the Christianisation of Croats began in the 7th century but the claim is disputed and generally Christianisation is associated with the 9th century[39] It is assumed that initially encompassed only the elite and related people[40] The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav[41] or his successor Trpimir I[42] The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces[43] The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke Branimir who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879[15]
Tomislav was the first king of Croatia noted as such in a letter of Pope John X in 925 Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions[44] The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV 1058–1074 and Dmitar Zvonimir 1075–1089[45] When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the Trpimirović dynasty Dmitar Zvonimir's brotherinlaw Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the Croatian crown This led to a war and personal union with Hungary in 1102 under Coloman[46]
For the next four centuries the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor parliament and a Ban viceroy appointed by the king[47] This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Šubić families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families[48] An increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and a struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas ensued The Venetians controlled most of Dalmatia by 1428 except the citystate of Dubrovnik which became independent Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and the 1526 Battle of Mohács both ending in decisive Ottoman victories King Louis II died at Mohács and in 1527 the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as the new ruler of Croatia under the condition that he protects Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights[47][49]
Following the decisive Ottoman victories Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538 The military territories became known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Habsburg control Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak the first decisive Ottoman defeat when borders stabilised[49] During the Great Turkish War 1683–1698 Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest remained outside Croatian control[49] The presentday border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome Dalmatia the southern part of the border was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars[50]
The Ottoman wars drove demographic changes During the 16th century Croats from western and northern Bosnia Lika Krbava the area between the rivers of Una and Kupa and especially from western Slavonia migrated towards Austria Presentday Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers[51][52] To replace the fleeing population the Habsburgs encouraged Bosnians to provide military service in the Military Frontier
The Croatian Parliament supported King Charles III's Pragmatic Sanction and signed their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712[53] Subsequently the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of the Kingdom of Croatia and Queen Maria Theresa made significant contributions to Croatian affairs such as introducing compulsory education
Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire increasingly occupied the eastern Adriatic coastline and its hinterland ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics establishing the Illyrian Provinces[49] In response the Royal Navy blockaded the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811[54] The Illyrian provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813 and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815 This led to the formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and the restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia under one crown[55] The 1830s and 1840s featured romantic nationalism that inspired the Croatian National Revival a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of South Slavs within the empire Its primary focus was establishing a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian while promoting Croatian literature and culture[56] During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with Austria Ban Josip Jelačić helped defeat the Hungarians in 1849 and ushered in a Germanisation policy[57]
By the 1860s the failure of the policy became apparent leading to the AustroHungarian Compromise of 1867 The creation of a personal union between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary followed The treaty left Croatia's status to Hungary which was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868 when the kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united[58] The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control while Rijeka retained the status of corpus separatum introduced in 1779[46]
After AustriaHungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin the Military Frontier was abolished The Croatian and Slavonian sectors of the Frontier returned to Croatia in 1881[49] under provisions of the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement[59][60] Renewed efforts to reform AustriaHungary entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit were stopped by World War I[61]
On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament Sabor declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes Croats and Serbs[47] which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes[62] The Croatian Parliament never ratified the union with Serbia and Montenegro[47] The 1921 constitution defining the country as a unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy
The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party—the Croatian Peasant Party HSS led by Stjepan Radić[63]
The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928 leading to King Alexander I to establish a dictatorship in January 1929[64] The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution[65] The HSS now led by Vladko Maček continued to advocate federalisation resulting in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia The Yugoslav government retained control of defence internal security foreign affairs trade and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crownappointed Ban[66]
In April 1941 Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy Following the invasion a GermanItalian installed puppet state named the Independent State of Croatia NDH was established Most of Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into this state Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy Hungary annexed the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje[67] The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše a fringe movement in prewar Croatia[68] With German and Italian military and political support[69] the regime introduced racial laws and launched a genocide campaign against Serbs Jews and Roma[70] Many were imprisoned in concentration camps the largest was the Jasenovac complex[71]  Antifascist Croats were targeted by the regime as well[72] Several concentration camps most notably the Rab Gonars and Molat camps were established in Italianoccupied territories mostly for Slovenes and Croats[71] At the same time the Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist Chetniks pursued a genocidal campaign against Croats and Muslims[70][73] aided by Italy[74] Nazi German forces committed crimes and reprisals against civilians in retaliation for Partisan actions such as in the villages of Kamešnica and Lipa in 1944[75][76] 
A resistance movement emerged On 22 June 1941[77] the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe[78] That sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement a communist multiethnic antifascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito[79] In ethnic terms Croats were the secondlargest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs[80] In per capita terms Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia[81] By May 1944 according to Tito Croats made up 30 of the Partisan's ethnic composition despite making up 22 of the population[80] The movement grew fast and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies[82]
With Allied support in logistics equipment training and airpower and with the assistance of Soviet troops taking part in the 1944 Belgrade Offensive the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of Italy and Austria by May 1945 Members of the NDH armed forces and other Axis troops as well as civilians were in retreat towards Austria Following their surrender many were killed in the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators[83] In the following years ethnic Germans faced persecution in Yugoslavia and many were interned[84]
The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the State Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament in 1945 and AVNOJ—its counterpart at the Yugoslav level[85][86]
Based on the studies on wartime and postwar casualties by demographer Vladimir Žerjavić and statistician Bogoljub Kočović a total of 295000 people from the territory not including territories ceded from Italy after the war died which amounted to 73 of the population[87] among whom were 125–137000 Serbs 118–124000 Croats 16–17000 Jews and 15000 Roma[88][89] In addition from areas joined to Croatia after the war a total of 32000 people died among whom 16000 were Italians and 15000 were Croats[90] Approximately 200000 Croats from the entirety of Yugoslavia including Croatia and abroad were killed in total throughout the war and its immediate aftermath approximately 54 of the population[91][92]
After World War II Croatia became a singleparty socialist federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia ruled by the Communists but having a degree of autonomy within the federation In 1967 Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding equal treatment for their language[93]
The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971 which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership[94] Still the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents[95]
Following Tito's death in 1980 the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated National tension was fanned by the 1986 SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina Kosovo and Montenegro[96][97] In January 1990 the Communist Party fragmented along national lines with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation[98] In the same year the first multiparty elections were held in Croatia while Franjo Tuđman's win exacerbated nationalist tensions[99] Some of the Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina intent on achieving independence from Croatia[100][101]
As tensions rose Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991 However the full implementation of the declaration only came into effect after a threemonth moratorium on the decision on 8 October 1991[102][103] In the meantime tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army JNA and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia[104] By the end of 1991 a highintensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia's control to about twothirds of its territory[105][106] Serb paramilitary groups then began a campaign of killing terror and expulsion of the Croats in the rebel territories killing thousands[107] of Croat civilians and expelling or displacing as many as 400000 Croats and other nonSerbs from their homes[108] Serbs living in Croatian towns especially those near the front lines were subjected to various forms of discrimination[109] Croatian Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina were forced to flee or were expelled by Croatian forces though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers[110] The Croatian Government publicly deplored these practices and sought to stop them indicating that they were not a part of the Government's policy [111]
On 15 January 1992 Croatia gained diplomatic recognition by the European Economic Community followed by the United Nations[112][113] The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia[114] the event is commemorated each year on 5 August as Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and the Day of Croatian Defenders[115] Following the Croatian victory about 200000 Serbs from the selfproclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina fled the region[116] and hundreds of mainly elderly Serb civilians were killed in the aftermath of the military operation[117] Their lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina[118] The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia following the Erdut Agreement of November 1995 concluding with the UNTAES mission in January 1998[119] Most sources number the war  deaths at around 20000[120][121][122]
After the end of the war Croatia faced the challenges of postwar reconstruction the return of refugees establishing democracy protecting human rights and general social and economic development The main law is the Constitution as adopted on 22 December 1990[clarification needed]
The post2000 period is characterised by democratisation economic growth structural and social reforms as well as problems such as unemployment corruption and the inefficiency of the public administration[123] In November 2000 and March 2001 the Parliament amended the Constitution changing its bicameral structure back into its historic unicameral form and reducing presidential powers[124]
Croatia joined the Partnership for Peace on 25 May 2000[125] and became a member of the World Trade Organization on 30 November 2000[126] On 29 October 2001 Croatia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union[127] submitted a formal application for the EU membership in 2003[128] was given the status of candidate country in 2004[129] and began accession negotiations in 2005[130]
In December 2011 Croatia completed EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011[131][132] Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY cooperation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes[133][134] 
Although the Croatian economy had enjoyed a significant boom in the early 2000s the financial crisis in 2008 forced the government to cut spending thus provoking a public outcry[135]
Croatia served on the United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term assuming the presidency in December 2008[136] On 1 April 2009 Croatia joined NATO[137]
A wave of antigovernment protests in early 2011 reflected a general dissatisfaction with politics and economics[138]
Croatia completed EU accession negotiations in 2011 A majority of Croatian voters opted in favour of EU membership in a 2012 referendum[139] Croatia joined the European Union effective 1 July 2013[140] Croatia was affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis when Hungary's closure of borders with Serbia pushed over 700000 refugees and migrants to pass through Croatia on their way to other countries[141]
On 19 October 2016 Andrej Plenković began serving as Croatian Prime Minister[142] The most recent presidential elections on 5 January 2020 elected Zoran Milanović as president[143]
Croatia is situated in Central and Southeast Europe on the coast of the Adriatic Sea Hungary is to the northeast Serbia to the east Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast and Slovenia to the northwest It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum[144] The Pelješac Bridge connects the exclave with mainland Croatia
The territory covers 56594 square kilometres 21851 square miles consisting of 56414 square kilometres 21782 square miles of land and 128 square kilometres 49 square miles of water It is the world's 127th largest country[145] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1831 metres 6007 feet near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south[145] to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size 48 of which permanently inhabited The largest islands are Cres and Krk[145] each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres 156 square miles
The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major rivers such as Danube Drava Kupa and the Sava The Danube Europe's second longest river runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Vojvodina The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands Natural resources found in quantities significant enough for production include oil coal bauxite lowgrade iron ore calcium gypsum natural asphalt silica mica clays salt and hydropower[145] Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps[147] Croatia hosts deep caves 49 of which are deeper than 250 m 82021 ft 14 deeper than 500 m 164042 ft and three deeper than 1000 m 328084 ft Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours ranging from turquoise to mint green grey or blue[148]
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification Mean monthly temperature ranges between −3 °C 27 °F in January and 18 °C 64 °F in July The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar featuring a snowy forested climate at elevations above 1200 metres 3900 feet The warmest areas are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by Mediterranean climate as the sea moderates temperature highs Consequently temperature peaks are more pronounced in continental areas The lowest temperature of −355 °C −319 °F was recorded on 3 February 1919 in Čakovec and the highest temperature of 428 °C 1090 °F was recorded on 4 August 1981 in Ploče[149][150]
Mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres 24 inches and 3500 millimetres 140 inches depending on geographic region and climate type The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands Biševo Lastovo Svetac Vis and the eastern parts of Slavonia However in the latter case rain occurs mostly during the growing season The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar[149]
Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local features Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast generally as the cool northeasterly bura or less frequently as the warm southerly jugo The sunniest parts are the outer islands Hvar and Korčula where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year[151]
Croatia can be subdivided into ecoregions based on climate and geomorphology The country is one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity[152][153] Croatia has four types of biogeographical regions—the Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar Pannonian along Drava and Danube and Continental in the remaining areas The most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers as well as underground habitats The country contains three ecoregions Dinaric Mountains mixed forests Pannonian mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests[154]
The karst geology harbours approximately 7000 caves and pits some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate—the olm Forests are significantly present as they cover 2490000 hectares 6200000 acres representing 44 of Croatian land area Other habitat types include wetlands grasslands bogs fens scrub habitats coastal and marine habitats[155]
In terms of phytogeography Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests[156]
Croatia hosts 37000 known plant and animal species but their actual number is estimated to be between 50000 and 100000[155] More than a thousand species are endemic especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains Adriatic islands and karst rivers Legislation protects 1131 species[155] The most serious threat is habitat loss and degradation A further problem is presented by invasive alien species especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae Croatia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 49210 ranking it 113th of 172 countries[157]
Invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect benthic habitat Indigenous cultivated plant strains and domesticated animal breeds are numerous They include five breeds of horses five of cattle eight of sheep two of pigs and one poultry Indigenous breeds include nine that are endangered or critically endangered[155] Croatia has 444 protected areas encompassing 9 of the country Those include eight national parks two strict reserves and ten nature parks The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is Plitvice Lakes National Park a UNESCO World Heritage Site Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme The strict and special reserves as well as the national and nature parks are managed and protected by the central government while other protected areas are managed by counties In 2005 the National Ecological Network was set up as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network[155]
The Republic of Croatia is a unitary constitutional state using a parliamentary system Government powers in Croatia are legislative executive and judiciary powers[158]
The President of the Republic Croatian Predsjednik Republike is the head of state directly elected to a fiveyear term and is limited by the Constitution to two terms In addition to serving as commander in chief of the armed forces the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the parliament and has some influence on foreign policy[158]

Croatia has a civil law legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes with judges serving as implementers and not creators of law Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems Croatian law is divided into two principal areas—private and public law Before EU accession negotiations were completed Croatian legislation had been fully harmonised with the Community acquis[162]
The main national courts are the Constitutional Court which oversees violations of the Constitution and the Supreme Court which is the highest court of appeal Administrative Commercial County Misdemeanor and Municipal courts handle cases in their respective domains[163] Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges Lay magistrates also participate in trials[164] The State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences[165]
